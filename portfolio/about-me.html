                I'm Evelyn Zhou and I've been playing tennis since elementary school. 
                I play the sport for fun, thrill, and fitness. Yet, tennis has also taught 
                me many important life lessons including collaboration, discipline, and mental
                toughness.
            </p>

                Outside of tennis, I enjoy watching movies, hiking and playing pool with
                 my cousins and sister.
